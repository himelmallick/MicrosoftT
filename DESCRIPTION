Description: A toolkit for differential analysis of omics data. Implements a range of statistical methodology based on the Tweedie distribution. Unlike traditional single-omics tools, Tweedieverse is technology-agnostic and can be applied to both count and continuous measurements arising from diverse high-throughput technologies (e.g. transcript abundances from bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq studies in the form of UMI counts or non-UMI counts, microbiome taxonomic and functional profiles in the form of counts or relative abundances, and compound abundance levels or peak intensities from metabolomics and other mass spectrometry-based experiments, among others). The software includes multiple analysis methods (e.g. self-adaptive, zero-inflated, and non-zero-inflated statistical models) as well as multiple customization options such as the inclusion of random effects and multiple covariates along with several data exploration capabilities and visualization modules in a unified estimation umbrella.
